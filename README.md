# Cyclo-Tourist Club / Member and Event Management & Club Treasury.

As the treasurer of a cycling club, the project aims to create a functional application (website) for managing club members, finances, and events, with the option for members to sign up for individual club events and receive email notifications. As a bonus, the site also features a cycling club gallery, club financial balance charts, and a contact form.

## !!! IMPORTANT UPDATE (JANUARY 2026) !!! - I decided to refactor most of the old code, both frontend and backend, so the project may not work properly in the next few days :)

# Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), JS
- Backend: Django, Python
- Database: SQLite3
- Data visualization library: Plotly
- Image processing library: Pillow
