# Cyclo-Tourist Club / Member and Event Management & Club Treasury.

As I'm the treasurer of a cycling club, the project aims to create a functional application (website) for managing club members, club finances, and club events, with the option for members to sign up for individual club events, including email notifications. As a bonus, the site also features a cycling club gallery, club financial balance charts, and a contact form.

## !!! IMPORTANT UPDATE (JANUARY 2026) !!! - I decided to refactor most of the old code, so the project may not work properly in the next few days/weeks :)

# Latest updates
- Sponsor and Sponsorship models added  
- Auth app added to the project.
- A confirmation email is sent to the user after registration for the club event.
- Contact template with 'contact us' form added to the project - emailing the club admin.
- The project got a new look (with some new CSS)
- Balance_graph.html fixed (grid container)
