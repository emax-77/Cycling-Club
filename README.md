This is my first Django project. In the beginning it should be a platform to manage members and their membership fees.
Later I will try to add other features and make it the homepage for our Cycling Club (Cyclo-Tourist Club Tvrdosin).

The CSS/JS style is not just mine - I took it mostly (with my little upgrades) from the w3schools.com Django tutorial project.

remarks for myself only / as I'm still beginner in Django :)
