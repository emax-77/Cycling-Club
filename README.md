This is my first Django project. In the beginning it should be a platform to manage members and their membership fees.
Later I will try to add other features and make it the homepage for our Cycling Club (Cyclo-Tourist Club Tvrdosin).

The CSS/JS style (on the main and member pages) is not mine - I took it from the Django tutorial project on W3schools.com
It looks like I need to replace it completely, as there are clashes with the rest of my project. And unfortunately my JavaScript skills aren't good enough yet to fix it quickly. I'm trying though :)

remarks for myself only / as I'm still beginner in Django :)
